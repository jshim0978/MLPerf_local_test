    " The Palestinian Authority has officially become the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court, giving the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. This move was opposed by Israel and the US, but welcomed by the Palestinians as a step towards greater justice and an end to impunity.

Let me know if you need any further changes. \n\nAlso, I would like to point out that the article mentions that the Palestinians may be subject to counter",

    " Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, has been making headlines for his role in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions with the US. He has been praised for his \"polished\" and \"jovial\" demeanor, but there are lesser-known facts about him, including his tweet wishing a happy Rosh Hashanah to Jews and his response to a tweet from Christine Pelosi criticizing Iran's Holocaust denial.

One of the five had a heart-related issue and has not left the area, while the others have returned home. The clinicians were being monitored as a precautionary measure after they had contact with a colleague who was diagnosed with Ebola.

    " Governments worldwide are using the threat of terrorism to justify the use of the death penalty, according to Amnesty International's annual report. The report highlights examples of Pakistan and China using the death penalty to combat terrorism, despite a decrease in global executions. Amnesty International argues that the death penalty is an ineffective deterrent and that governments are \"playing with people's lives\" by using it to address security threats.\n\nNote: The article does not mention Belarus in the text, it seems to be an error in the summary. \n\nHere is a revised summary:\n\nSummary: Governments worldwide are using the threat of terrorism to justify the use of the death penalty, according to",
    " Andrew Getty, the 47-year-old grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, has died of natural causes, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The coroner's preliminary assessment is that there was no foul play involved in his death, and an autopsy will be conducted to confirm the cause of death. Getty's parents have released a statement confirming their son's death and asking for privacy.\n\nNote: I did not include the information about the Getty family fortune in the summary as it is not directly related to the cause of Andrew Getty's death.
