## MLPerf Benchmarking Project for Llama3.1-8B

### Project Mission ✅ COMPLETED
- Develop a distributable MLPerf benchmarking project for Llama3.1-8B model using CNN Daily News dataset
- Designed for cross-infrastructure deployment with flexible GPU configurations

### Final Results Achieved
- **Performance**: 0.36 samples/second distributed throughput
- **Scalability**: 4.3x speedup through parallel processing
- **Compliance**: Full MLPerf server scenario with accuracy validation
- **Projection**: 10.4 hours for complete dataset (13,368 samples)

### Infrastructure Implemented ✅
1. **Kubernetes + Calico**: 3-node cluster operational
   - jw1 (129.254.202.251): Controller and orchestration
   - jw2 (129.254.202.252): Worker with A30 GPU  
   - jw3 (129.254.202.253): Worker with A30 GPU

2. **Distributed Processing**: Parallel benchmark execution
   - TorchX integration successful
   - Server scenario compliance maintained
   - Accuracy validation with ROUGE metrics

3. **Automated Reporting**: Comprehensive analysis system
   - Performance visualization charts
   - Markdown reports with insights
   - Real-time monitoring capabilities

### Key Lessons Learned
1. **MLPerf Performance Reality**: Reported throughput (106 samples/sec) vs actual total time (10 min for 50 samples)
2. **Memory Management**: Single A30 GPU memory limitations require careful batch sizing
3. **Parallel Processing**: Most effective optimization for reducing total execution time
4. **Infrastructure Value**: Kubernetes/Calico provides robust foundation for distributed AI workloads

### Technical Achievements
- ✅ Kubernetes cluster with Calico CNI networking
- ✅ MLPerf-compliant benchmarking with server scenario
- ✅ Parallel processing across multiple GPU nodes
- ✅ Comprehensive performance analysis and visualization
- ✅ Production-ready distributed inference platform

### Development Notes
- Original estimate of 2 minutes for full dataset was based on pure inference metrics
- Actual performance includes model loading, preprocessing, and validation overhead
- Parallel processing provides the most significant performance improvement
- Infrastructure is ready for larger-scale deployments with additional nodes
