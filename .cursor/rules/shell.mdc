# Applies when editing shell scripts

## Style
- `set -euo pipefail` when safe; at minimum `set -e`.
- Use functions per stage with clear logging.
- Avoid interactive prompts; pass non-interactive flags.

## Safety
- Never echo secrets; require env vars and validate presence.
- Create output dirs with `-p`; use timestamped names.
- Use `trap` for cleanup on exit when starting long-running jobs.

## Output
- Print concise metrics; avoid dumping large files to stdout.
