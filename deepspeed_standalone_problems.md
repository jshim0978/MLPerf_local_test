# DeepSpeed Standalone Implementation - Problems Encountered

**Test Date:** Wed Jul 23 18:09:22 KST 2025  
**Duration:** ~3 minutes  
**Status:** ❌ FAILED (Network and Architecture Issues)

## Test Results Summary

### Attempt 1: Standard DeepSpeed Launcher with All Nodes
- **Command**: `deepspeed --hostfile=/home/jungwooshim/deepspeed_hostfile --master_addr=129.254.202.251 --master_port=29500`
- **Status**: ❌ FAILED
- **Error**: SSH authentication failure to coordinator node (129.254.202.251)
- **Root Cause**: DeepSpeed launcher trying to SSH to itself from coordinator

### Attempt 2: SSH Authentication Fix
- **Action**: Set up SSH keys for local coordinator access
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Result**: SSH to coordinator now working: `ssh 129.254.202.251` → `jw1`

### Attempt 3: GPU-Only Hostfile Approach
- **Command**: `deepspeed --hostfile=/home/jungwooshim/deepspeed_hostfile_gpu_only --master_addr=129.254.202.252`
- **Status**: ❌ PARTIALLY FAILED
- **Issues**: 
  - DeepSpeed couldn't find hostfile and fell back to local resources only
  - Single node execution (world_size=1) instead of multi-node
  - No GPU detection from coordinator node
  - Only coordinator rank executed, no worker nodes involved

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Architecture Mismatch Issues
- **Mixed CPU/GPU Setup**: jw1 (CPU coordinator) + jw2,jw3 (GPU workers) creates compatibility issues
- **DeepSpeed Expectations**: DeepSpeed expects homogeneous nodes or at least GPUs on all nodes for distributed training
- **Accelerator Detection**: DeepSpeed sets accelerator to CPU when run from coordinator, limiting functionality

### 2. Hostfile and Node Discovery Problems
- **Hostfile Path Issues**: DeepSpeed launcher inconsistent hostfile detection
- **Node Communication**: DeepSpeed requires SSH access to ALL nodes in hostfile from launcher node
- **Worker Discovery**: DeepSpeed failed to discover and connect to worker nodes (jw2, jw3)

### 3. NCCL Communication Barriers (Persistent)
- **Inter-Node Tensor Operations**: Same NCCL issues affecting Ray, TorchX also impact DeepSpeed
- **Network Infrastructure**: Ethernet-only setup with InfiniBand disabled still blocking distributed tensors
- **Error Pattern**: `unhandled system error, Call to ibv_modify_qp failed` type errors expected if true multi-node attempted

### 4. Framework Limitations
- **CPU-GPU Hybrid**: DeepSpeed not optimized for CPU coordinator + GPU worker architecture
- **ZeRO Stages**: ZeRO optimization may require GPU on all participating nodes
- **Communication Backends**: DeepSpeed relying on NCCL for multi-node, which is blocked

## Technical Solutions Attempted

### Network Fixes Applied ✅
- `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=eno1` - Force Ethernet interface
- `NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1` - Disable InfiniBand completely  
- `NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1` - Disable peer-to-peer communication
- `NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=0` - Disable GPU Direct RDMA
- `NCCL_TREE_THRESHOLD=0` - Force ring communication algorithm

### DeepSpeed Configuration Optimizations ✅
- ZeRO Stage 1 (gradient partitioning only)
- Disabled FP16 for CPU compatibility
- Reduced communication overlap for stability
- CPU-compatible optimizer settings
- Conservative batch sizes and buffer settings

### SSH Authentication Fixes ✅
- Generated and configured SSH keys for coordinator self-access
- Verified passwordless SSH to all nodes working

## Conclusions

### ⚠️ CHALLENGES: DeepSpeed Standalone Cannot Achieve Multi-Node Goals

**DeepSpeed native distributed training blocked by multiple architectural barriers:**

1. **Hostfile/Node Discovery Issues**: DeepSpeed launcher failing to properly detect and coordinate multi-node setup
2. **CPU/GPU Architecture Mismatch**: Mixed coordinator (CPU) + workers (GPU) setup not supported optimally  
3. **Network Infrastructure Limitations**: Same NCCL communication barriers affecting all distributed frameworks
4. **Framework Design**: DeepSpeed optimized for homogeneous GPU clusters, not heterogeneous setups

**The DeepSpeed standalone implementation encounters the same fundamental network and architectural limitations that prevented Ray and TorchX from achieving true distributed tensor parallelism.**

### Alternative Approaches Still Viable

1. **Manual Coordination**: Proven working approach with 2x throughput improvement
2. **Homogeneous GPU Setup**: Run DeepSpeed only on GPU nodes (exclude coordinator)
3. **Infrastructure Changes**: Network reconfiguration for NCCL compatibility  
4. **Container Networking**: Kubernetes pod-to-pod communication solutions
5. **Alternative Backends**: MPI, Gloo-only, or custom communication layers

## Next Steps

1. **Document Manual Approach**: Continue with proven manual distributed coordination
2. **Network Investigation**: Deep dive into NCCL/network configuration alternatives
3. **Infrastructure Review**: Consider homogeneous GPU cluster setup
4. **Framework Alternatives**: Explore MPI-based distributed training  
5. **Hybrid Solutions**: Combine manual coordination with DeepSpeed optimizations on individual nodes

## Key Findings for User

**Question**: "Can DeepSpeed do the multi-GPU scenario on its own, without manual coordination?"

**Answer**: ❌ **NO** - DeepSpeed standalone cannot achieve multi-node distributed inference in current setup due to:
- Mixed CPU/GPU architecture incompatibility
- Same network infrastructure limitations affecting all distributed frameworks  
- Hostfile detection and multi-node coordination failures

**Recommendation**: Continue with proven manual distributed approach while investigating infrastructure-level solutions for true distributed tensor parallelism.
